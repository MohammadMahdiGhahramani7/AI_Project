Abstract:

Attempting to analyze and understand the sentiment of a sentence has always been useful. Its application ranges from document classification to customer comment classification for companies who are providing a service and would like to automatically get informed about their customers’ feelings about their services. This study reviews how to assign an emoji to a given sentence which is the best representation of that sentence. The first contribution of this research is to use a pre-trained word embedder and take advantage of averaging method on sentences’ words and consider a simple neural network to classify the sentences. However, in the second contribution, it reveals the fact that by using Recurrent neural networks (RNNs), the performance of the model increases. The dataset used to conduct this research consists of approximately 130 training samples and 60 test samples. Five different emojis are considered to label these samples.
